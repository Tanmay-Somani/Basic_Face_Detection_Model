# Basic_Face_Detection_Model
## Face Detection Model
This project implements a face detection model using OpenCV, capable of recognizing faces belonging to two categories: "Hemant Gami" and "Everyone Else".

# Features:
Utilizes LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognizer for accurate face recognition.
- Training process iterates through a directory containing training images of individuals.
- Trained model is saved for later use, along with extracted features and labels.
  
# Usage:
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/face-detection-model.git
```
Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
Navigate to the project directory and run file1.py:
```
bash
python file1.py
```
Once training completes, the trained model will be saved as 'face_trained.yml', along with features and labels.

You can now use the trained model for face recognition tasks.
